## Hello World

1. Creat a file named as helloworld with the file extension `kt`

```kotlin
fun main() {
    println("Hello world")
}
````

`fun -> function`

Naming a function with the name `main` is special. Whenever the program is executed, automatically the main function will be invoked. 
It is an entry point to the program.,
